https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-lodderstedt-oauth-par-00.html

The Internet draft defines the pushed authorization request endpoint,
which allows clients to push the payload of an OAuth 2.0 authorization
request to the authorization server via a direct request and provides
them with a request URI that is used as reference to the data in a
subsequent authorization request.
